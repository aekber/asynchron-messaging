Asynchron messaging application by Ali Ekber Celik.This application developed under Ubuntu 16.04 x64 OS with Java 8.

VehicleManager is a Spring MVC application where you can manage vehicles(create new vehicle and manage their directions).
When a new car is created in /newVehicle page, it is placed with 'NEW' status.Then VehicleManager application sends this request to VehicleProcessor application using JMS queue via ActiveMQ Message broker.

Also VehicleManager application configures a listener to get VehicleProcessor's response on another queue.
By the way VehicleProcessor is also Spring-based application and it is deployed as war,and gets new cars/redirected cars then processes them.

It also sends process response on the response queue. After receiving process response from VehicleProcess application, VehicleManager application updates the vehicle status in itâ€™s repository.

The project is based on a small messaging app which uses the following technologies:

* Java 1.8
* Spring MVC 4
* JMS & ActiveMQ 5.13
* Tomcat 8
* Maven 3.5
* Eclipse


Before build this project using Maven,we need to start ActiveMQ for our test scripts.

## Run ActiveMQ

$> cd your_activemq_path/bin

$> sudo ./activemq start


Then,following two commands must be run seperately for VehicleManager and VehicleProcessor

## Enter application folder

$> cd your_application_folder_path

## Build application from source

$> mvn clean install

After that,import these projects into Eclipse(or take war files to Tomcat webapps folder and start tomcat from command line), deploy VehicleManager to Tomcat in Eclipse and start Tomcat.You can add new vehicle and redirect an existing vehicle using this project.Basically,main page of this project is http://localhost:8080/VehicleManager/ You can also navigate with links below the page to list existing vehicles' status and positions.

When you completed vehicle operations,you can deploy VehicleProcessor project to Tomcat in Eclipse.This project will process your operations.And it will change these vehicles' status.New statuses can be seen in VehicleManager project web ui.

Also you can see your queues' status in ActiveMQ admin page(http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp)
